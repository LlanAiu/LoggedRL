# Logged RL

A simple implementation of logging in a reinforcement learning (Connect 4) context, mainly for debugging purposes.

This has significant inspiration from my work here: https://github.com/LlanAiu/PengDa; however, the structure is overhauled to be less dependent on application specific requirements.

Built for the TechXathon Fall 2024.
